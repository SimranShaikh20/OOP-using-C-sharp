# Student Grades System

The **Student Grades System** is a simple console-based application built using C#. This project is designed to help manage student information and calculate their grades based on their total marks. It serves as a practical example of object-oriented programming concepts like classes, properties, and methods in action.

## Project Description

This project allows users to input multiple students' details, such as their name, surname, roll number, age, and total marks. The program then calculates the grade for each student based on predefined criteria and displays it. The application is ideal for learning and practicing C# programming, focusing on handling user input, arrays of objects, and conditional statements.

## Features

- Collect and store details for multiple students.
- Grade calculation based on the total marks:
  - **A+**: Marks ≥ 90
  - **A**: Marks ≥ 80 and < 90
  - **B+**: Marks ≥ 70 and < 80
  - **B**: Marks ≥ 60 and < 70
  - **Needs Improvement**: Marks < 60
- Clean and user-friendly console interface.

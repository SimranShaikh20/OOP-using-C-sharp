# OOP using C#

This repository demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using the **C#** programming language. It contains simple, clear examples to help understand the foundational principles of OOP in real-world C# code.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

This project covers the following key object-oriented programming concepts:

- **Inheritance** – Code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.
- **Polymorphism** – Method overloading and overriding.
- **Encapsulation** – Restricting access to certain details of an object.
- **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
- **Interfaces** – Defining contracts that implementing classes must follow.
- **Delegates** – Representing references to methods and enabling callback mechanisms.
- **Generics** – Writing type-safe and reusable code components.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)** – Querying collections using a SQL-like syntax.
